# Capstone-Project
Deep Learning in Finance: Time series prediction. 

Goals and Objectives

Our goals in this project are:

1. To explore the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, as a tool for making directional predictions for assets.
2. To improve the predictive power of the LSTM model by incorporating financial ratios, advanced technical indicators, and volatility estimators as features.
3. To utilize the results of exploratory data analysis to guide the selection of features for the LSTM model.

While the objectives are:

1. To classify the assets as "buy" or "sell" based on the closing price comparison between tomorrow and today.
2. To classify up/down moves in stock indices, stocks, and FX rates (EUR/USD) using LSTM.
3. To handle sequences of arbitrary length in the LSTM model, which means that longer time frames such as 5-day, 10-day, or 1-week returns can be used for prediction.
4. To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns in the data.
5. To overcome the challenges of predicting 5-day, 10-day returns for equities or 1-week, 1-month returns for financial factors, including the need for a large amount of data and the isolation of positive autocorrelation.
